Main method class: ams.gui.GUIMain

If there are any graphics issues try setting 
NIMBUS_LOOK_AND_FEEL in GUIMain to false, this
will revert the program to swing's default look
and feel.

For ease of testing some debug code has been included
to enter debug mode set DEBUG_MODE in GUIMain to true,
this has a few small effects on the system including
adding a menu for importing some test data.

The model in use is entirely Mikhail's Ass1 solution and
is therefore not my own work.
